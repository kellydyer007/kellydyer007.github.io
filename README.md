## Purpose

Every year I take a trip with my boyfriend and his family to Pensacola Beach in the heat of the Summer. Soak up some sun and enjoy everyones company. The past few years I have gone with, I find my self asking when the tiny and thriving beach city will cease to exist due to sea level rise. This year, I decided to take that question to answer for my final data science lifecycle project, CMSC 320 at University of Maryland, and expand upon it.
