## Purpose

  Every year I take a trip with my boyfriend and his family to Pensacola Beach in the heat of the Summer. Soak up some sun and enjoy everyones company. The past few years I have gone with, I find my self asking when the tiny and thriving beach city will cease to exist due to sea level rise. As I was taking a Summer class this year, I decided to answer the question that has been brewing for my final data science lifecycle project, in CMSC 320 Intro to Data Science at University of Maryland, and expand upon it. 

  I am going to take you through the data science lifecycle and my steps to answering the question of what year Pensacola, and later other cities, will begin to flood due purely to the rise in sea level.

### Data Collection

  The first step for any data science problem is determining the data you need and gathering it. Because I want to know when a landmass will flood due to rises in the oceans, I looked for sea level measurements over the past years. I was able to find data collected by four satillites, TPOEX/POSIDEON, Jason-1, Jason-2, and Jason-3, funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) containing data from 1992 to 2020.
